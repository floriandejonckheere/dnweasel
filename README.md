# Dawkins' Network Weasel

Dnweasel is a networked version of [Dawkin's weasel algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_program). The client starts by sending a chosen string over the network to the server, and then the two components apply Dawkin's algorithm to the string (for a chosen number of iterations) and send it back.
